# 🎮 How to Play TriMorris

## Game Objective
Be the first player to align three of your tokens in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

## Game Setup
- 2 Players: Player 1 (Blue 🔵) and Player 2 (Red 🔴)
- Each player has 3 tokens
- 9 junction points connected by lines forming a square with diagonals and midlines

## Game Flow

### Phase 1: Placing Tokens
1. Players take turns placing their tokens on empty junctions
2. Player 1 goes first with blue tokens
3. Continue alternating until all 6 tokens are placed on the board

### Phase 2: Moving Tokens
1. Once all tokens are placed, players take turns moving their tokens
2. Select one of your tokens by tapping on it (it will highlight in gold)
3. Available moves will be highlighted in green
4. Tap a green junction to move your selected token there
5. You can only move to adjacent junctions connected by lines

## Controls
- **Tap empty junction**: Place a token (during placing phase)
- **Tap your token**: Select it to see possible moves (during moving phase)
- **Tap green junction**: Move your selected token there
- **Tap selected token again**: Deselect it

## Winning Conditions
- **Immediate Win**: Get three of your tokens in a straight line
- **Opponent Cannot Move**: If your opponent has no valid moves, you win

## Strategy Tips
1. **Block opponent**: Try to prevent your opponent from getting three in a line
